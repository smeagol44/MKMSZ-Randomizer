# Native UI and presentation

## Confirmed gameplay HUD path

The stable gameplay HUD function is `0x8005BFB0`. It contains 13 calls to node submitter `0x8001EAE4`. Production hooks one call at ROM `0x5D9CC`, executes the displaced submission first, then draws the box indicator.

Render nodes are allocated by `0x8002018C` and are `0x58` bytes/22 words. Vertex X/Y halfwords occur at `+0x08/+0x0A`, `+0x18/+0x1A`, `+0x28/+0x2A`, and `+0x38/+0x3A`; colors are at `+0x14`, `+0x24`, `+0x34`, and `+0x44`.

## Native text

| Purpose | Address |
|---|---:|
| Text draw | `0x80073E74` |
| Width calculation | `0x80074084` |
| Font data | `0x800B1E20` |

Arbitrary null-terminated strings placed in custom RDRAM were runtime-confirmed. This is the preferred path for small persistent gameplay labels.

The production wrapper occupies ROM `0xAFA24..0xAFA97`, begins at VA `0x800AEE24`, and stores its string at VA `0x800AEE80`. It reads active-box state, rewrites the digit in `BOX 1 OF 4`, and draws at `x=230`, `y=210`. This area was originally legal-screen text, but the exact stock bytes are guarded and boot branding owns the adjacent strings.

## Context-specific renderer family

The path beginning at `0x80073CEC` and calling `0x8001E578` is real, but evidence shows it is context-specific rather than a universal always-on HUD/sprite API. Its suitability as a generic presentation abstraction remains unproven.

## Pickup presentation descriptors

| Descriptor | ROM | Count/use |
|---:|---:|---|
| `0x800B1BAC` | `0xB27AC` | Potion, 16 entries |
| `0x800B1BD0` | `0xB27D0` | Generic A/crystals |
| `0x800B1D18` | `0xB2918` | Generic B/keys and icons, 14 entries |
| `0x800B1D38` | `0xB2938` | Jar/item presentation |

The resource selector in a pickup record is stage-local; its presentation descriptor alone does not import model data.

## Failed approaches and open work

- Direct framebuffer drawing was unstable and is rejected.
- Searching for one universal sprite API produced context-dependent candidates, not a safe abstraction.
- An inline wrapper that allocates and submits multiple nodes works; an over-generalized helper layer did not.
- General textured-image rendering remains unresolved.
- The Temple XP proof currently reuses a pale blue-grey Herbs-like model. Desired final art is a bright-blue body with bronze handle and still needs a production resource path.


## 1.0 randomizer HUD requirement

The legacy Lua overlay is the behavioral reference for the information a player needs while hunting a seed. It displayed:

- progression/power requirement;
- inventory page number;
- current-stage checks collected / total;
- key-item progress by stage;
- temporary `Picked up: <item>` feedback.

The native product currently implements only `BOX n OF 4`. 1.0 requires a native randomizer HUD that exposes equivalent useful run-state information. Exact visual parity with the emulator overlay is not required, but the gameplay information is.

The runtime-confirmed native text path at `0x80073E74` is the preferred basis for text elements. Geometric key-progress icons may use native render nodes only after a bounded proof; a text-first representation is acceptable if it conveys the same state reliably.


## Toasty presentation target

The intended Toasty feature is now split into independently testable presentation and audio pieces.

**Static-confirmed donor behavior:** MKT's `forden_peek` creates the genuine 97x100 `TOASTY` image with its 64-color `TOASTY_P` palette, slides it in from the right for 6 ticks, stops it for `0x20` ticks while playing the Toasty voice, reverses horizontal velocity, slides it out for `0x10` ticks, then deletes it. The donor `randper(40)` gate is 40/1000 = 4%, approximately one qualifying event in 25.

**Static-confirmed audio feasibility:** the retail MKT Toasty voice is a non-looping `0x2A54`-byte N64 ADPCM sample and MKMSZ uses a compatible native sound-bank grammar/playback family. A no-growth in-place sound proof is available through dormant raw sound ID 550. See [MKT to MKMSZ compatibility layer](MKT-to-MKMSZ-Compatibility-Layer).

**Pending:** runtime validation of the imported sound, then the remaining textured screen-space/object binding for the 97x100 image. General textured-image rendering is still not claimed as solved until that bounded proof succeeds.
